        <h1>About Communiqu&eacute;</h1>

<p>Hello, I&#39;m Holly, and I&nbsp;am a bureaucrat. I&nbsp;loosely manage the <a href="http://wbdatalab.org/">World Bank Data Lab</a> and <a href="https://datapartnership.org/">Development Data Partnership</a> programs. I am very proud of these programs,&nbsp;and few days go by when I am not exceedly grateful for / astounded by my highly skilled and deeply motivated colleagues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pace of change in how we use data to inform public sector decisionnmaking is dizzying, and to keep on top of things, my own learning pace has become dizzying. Or it could be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)">Old Fashioned&#39;s</a> that accompany the learning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, in a mid-life crisis spurt to prove to my younger colleagues that I&#39;ve still got it, I&#39;ve been taking self-paced coding classes and built this website. In theory, this site will&nbsp;incentivize me to keep up with my coding projects, refine my musings, and help me remember all the wonderful stories and ideas I&#39;ve been reading. I would say that I am writing this for *you* and that I am deeply interested in your comments, but I had to disable comments because, frankly, the relational database + website permissions based on user admin classes proved too daunting. Maybe in another month or two. Or year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please do not hack my site -- I have not gotten to the class&nbsp;on web security yet (but even if I did, I may skip it -- yawn). But I did hash and salt (8 times!) my login password, so take that üôÖ&zwj;‚ôÄÔ∏è.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit. I hope your effort rewards you with a smile and something learned. üòå</p>

<p>Holly</p>
