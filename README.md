<h1> Communiqué </h1>

<p>The Pandemic Pause was a big step outside of my life&#39;s&nbsp;rythms -- leading to changes not just in routine, but also in skills and priorities. As family responsibilities multiplied and work challenges grew, so did my appetite to escape into books and&nbsp;learn to code. With these two acts -- reading and coding -- I could ignore that one more thing that needed&nbsp;to be written/cleaned/cooked/fixed/taught, telling myself that learning&nbsp;is also important.</p>

<p>For my coding course, I will&nbsp;design 20 applications based on one-line prompts, like &quot;Build an On-Line Store with a Payment Mechanism&quot; or &quot;Analyze and Visualize the Space Race&quot;. I&#39;ve built this site to record these efforts&nbsp;and anything else I may learn along the way...</p>

<p>Thank you for taking a moment to see what I&#39;ve been up to...</p>

<p>❤️</p>
